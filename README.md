# Game_mechanics_in_CPlusPlus

This is the framework of a basic platformer video game. No external inputs or outputs are handled with this code, but most of the internal mechanics and logic necessary are here.

I've written this software to be a easy engine to plug into any of my future platforming video games, to avoid the hassle of rewriting basic mechanics over and over again.

I used C++ syntax for this entire program, and i used the [what] libraries.
